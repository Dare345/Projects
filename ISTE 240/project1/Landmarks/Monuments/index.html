                    Located in Block Island on Corn Neck Road. Settler's Rock is a Monument
                    erected in the 1991 by European Settlers. The names of the settlers' families as well as
                    where they reach shore are all engraved on the rock. These settlers arrived
                    at Block Island in 1662 seeking to make a democratic settlement that would be free of their
                    homeland's persecution. Although the land was harsh conditions and had dangerous natives, they were 
                    able to be hidden and isolated from their homeland.

                    Located in Little Compton at 18 Main Street. The Red Chicken monument is to honor
                    the breeding of chickens that lead to a trading achievement of laying around 2 million eggs.
                    The monument was sculpted by the American Sculptor, Henry L. Norton. This achievement was done 
                    by Issac Wilbour that bred chickens from Willam Tripp with his own. Willam Tripp himself had bred
                     his chickens with exotic roosters from Asia that were tall and bright red. 
                     After breeding them he noticed how much bigger and meatier his chickens were. However, the most
                     important change was their egg production giving Issac the chance to mass produce eggs.
