                    500,000 cubic feet of marble when it was built by the architect, Richard Morris Hunt, in 1888.
                    It was mainly used as a summer cottage for the Vanderbilt family costing around 11 million
                    dollars where most of it was due to the marble. The wealth of the Vanderbilt family originates from the manufacturing of steam ships and the New York Central
                    Railroad. The house was unlike any other house during its time where instead of wood
                    it was made out of marble. Its considered a historical landmark due to how it
                    sparked a change in Newport's buildings from old wooden houses to beautiful stone palaces.

                    burned down. The building itself was inspired by the style of buildings during the Italian Renaissance
                    and open court yards. The mansion had 70 rooms that included 48 bedrooms for staf and family. It was purchased
                    by the Preservation Society in 1972 from Cornelius' grand children.

                     making use of shingle wood for the walls of the building. The house
