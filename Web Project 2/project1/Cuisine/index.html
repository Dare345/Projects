                    This dish is a local favorite which makes use of Quahogs, a staple ingredient
                    for Rhode Island local cuisine. Stuffies are incredibly delicious and sweet
                    with them served straight out from the oven. The dish is made by chopping the Quahogs
                    and mixing them with onions, crushed pepper flakes, Italian bread, and some of their homemade
                    briny juice. If your interested you could try visiting the Amaral's Fish & Chips
                    located in Waren at 4 Redmond Street.

                    Clam Casinos was a staple dish in Rhode Island's clam shacks and fancy
                    diners. In order to perfect this dish the owner of Matunuck Oyster Bar,
                    Perry Raso, traveled around the state with his chef to perfect this dish.
                    The clams from Matunuck Oyster Bar are all freshly caught each morning making
                    their Clam Casinos to taste very unique. They make it by stuffing the clams with
                    bell peppers, bacon, breadcrumbs and with a bit of sherry. You can find the bar
                    in South Kingston at 629 Succotash Road.
